# Contribution

- Ruvenn - data visualisation
- Jun Koon - multi linear regression and data cleaning
- Kenze - slides and presentation

# Problem Definition
- How can we predict future covid deaths in Asia?
- How do past covid variables affect future covid statistics in Asia?

# Models Used
- Multi linear regression
- Data cleaning & visualization

# What we learned/Conclusion
- Variables that were perceived to have high impact, resulted in unsatisfactory results
- Regression equations between each independent variable and the dependent variable
- Predictions are highly dependent on the current spreading regime
- Different additional variables would be beneficial
